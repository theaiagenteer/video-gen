# VideoGen Agency PRD (v1.0)

## Objective
Create a three-agent media production agency that can research topics, plan responses, and generate multimedia assets (voiceovers, screenshots of code snippets, and images) under a manager’s direction.

## Agents
1) **Manager Agent** (entry point)  
   - Intake user goals/requirements and confirm scope.  
   - Break requests into research and asset-generation tasks; set quality criteria.  
   - Review research summaries and asset drafts; request revisions; deliver final package.

2) **Research Agent**  
   - Perform live web research using `WebSearchTool`.  
   - Produce concise summaries with citations/links and recommended talking points or scripts.  
   - Highlight gaps/risks for the Manager to resolve.

3) **Assets Generator**  
   - Generate voiceovers via ElevenLabs TTS tool.  
   - Render code snapshots via a Ray.so Playwright tool.  
   - Generate images via `ImageGenerationTool`.  
   - Use `PersistentShellTool` for lightweight editing/combining assets (no files folder usage; operate in dedicated output directories).

## Tools
- **WebSearchTool** (built-in) — Research Agent.  
- **GenerateVoiceoverTool** (custom, ElevenLabs API) — Assets Generator.  
- **RaySoSnapshotTool** (custom, Playwright) — Assets Generator.  
- **ImageGenerationTool** (built-in) — Assets Generator.  
- **PersistentShellTool** (built-in) — Assets Generator for editing/combining outputs.

### Tool Outputs & Paths
- Default to saving generated assets under `outputs/` (e.g., `outputs/voiceovers/`, `outputs/snapshots/`, `outputs/images/`).  
- Final video renders should target `/mnt/video_final/<filename>` when available; if the directory is missing, ask the user to create/provide an alternative.  
- Do **not** use `files/` directories for custom code or storage.

## Communication Flow (orchestrator)
- Manager ↔ Research Agent  
- Manager ↔ Assets Generator  
- Manager is the sole user-facing entry point.

## Environment & Keys
- Required: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (all agents, built-in tools).  
- Required: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (GenerateVoiceoverTool).  
- Playwright browsers: run `python -m playwright install chromium` once after dependencies.

## Assumptions
- User provides clear content goals (topic, audience, tone, target formats).  
- Voiceover text provided or synthesized from research summaries.  
- Ray.so accepts direct code snippets without additional auth.

## Open Questions for User
1) What should we name the agency (e.g., `videogen_agency`)?  
2) Preferred default output directories/file names for voiceovers, snapshots, and images?  
3) Voiceover defaults: language/voice/model/output format ok as in provided snippet?  
4) Ray.so snapshot defaults: theme/background preferences?  
5) Final video path: is `/mnt/video_final/<filename>` guaranteed to exist, or should we prompt before rendering there?  
6) Any content safety/brand constraints the Manager should enforce?  
7) Does “DONT ADD FILES FOLDER CODE Anywhere” mean no `files/` directories at all, or simply no code placed there?
